# Scout Feature Flags Configuration Guide

## 🎯 Available Feature Flags

Scout now supports feature flags for safe testing and gradual rollouts! Control features through environment variables.

## 🔧 Environment Variables

### Core Feature Flags
```bash
# Connection Resilience Features
ENABLE_RESILIENCE=false          # Enable connection resilience & auto-reconnection
ENHANCED_LOGGING=false           # Detailed logging for debugging
DEBUG_MODE=false                 # Debug information in commands
TESTING_MODE=false               # Beta testing mode indicators

# Optional Features  
ENABLE_HEALTH_ENDPOINT=false     # HTTP health check endpoint
FEATURE_BRANCH=main              # Track which branch/version is running
```

### Required Environment Variables (unchanged)
```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GUILD_ID=your_server_id
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=your_deployment_name
```

## 🚀 Azure App Service Configuration

### Production (Stable)
```
Azure Portal → Your App Service → Configuration → Application Settings:

ENABLE_RESILIENCE=false
DEBUG_MODE=false
TESTING_MODE=false
ENHANCED_LOGGING=false
ENABLE_HEALTH_ENDPOINT=true
FEATURE_BRANCH=main
```

### Beta Testing (New Features)
```
ENABLE_RESILIENCE=true          # 🛡️ Test connection resilience
DEBUG_MODE=true                 # 🔍 See feature status
TESTING_MODE=true               # 🧪 Beta mode indicators
ENHANCED_LOGGING=true           # 📝 Detailed logs
ENABLE_HEALTH_ENDPOINT=true     # 🏥 Health monitoring
FEATURE_BRANCH=feature/real-time-data
```

### Gradual Rollout (50% testing)
```
ENABLE_RESILIENCE=true          # Enable for testing
DEBUG_MODE=false                # Production logging
TESTING_MODE=false              # No beta indicators
ENHANCED_LOGGING=false          # Standard logs
RESILIENCE_ROLLOUT=50           # 50% of users get new features
```

## 🎮 Testing Workflow

### 1. Test New Features
```bash
# In Azure Portal:
1. Configuration → Application Settings
2. Set ENABLE_RESILIENCE=true
3. Set TESTING_MODE=true
4. Save → Scout restarts with features
5. Test Scout with enhanced features
6. Use /features command to verify status
```

### 2. Monitor with New Commands
```bash
/connection     # Check connection health (resilience feature)
/features       # Show feature flag status (debug mode)
/monitoring     # Enhanced monitoring stats
```

### 3. Roll Back Safely
```bash
# If issues arise:
1. Set ENABLE_RESILIENCE=false
2. Save → Scout returns to stable version
3. No downtime, instant rollback!
```

## 🔄 Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Deploy with Flags Off
```bash
1. Deploy new Scout with all flags disabled
2. Production runs exactly like before
3. Verify stability
```

### Phase 2: Enable for Testing
```bash
1. Turn on TESTING_MODE=true
2. Enable specific features for testing
3. Monitor /connection and /features commands
```

### Phase 3: Gradual Rollout
```bash
1. Enable features for subset of users
2. Monitor performance and errors
3. Gradually increase rollout percentage
```

### Phase 4: Full Deployment
```bash
1. Enable all stable features
2. Turn off testing indicators
3. Production with enhanced features!
```

## 🎯 Why Feature Flags Rock

### ✅ Benefits You'll See:
- **Zero Downtime Testing** - Toggle features instantly
- **Safe Experimentation** - Test without breaking production
- **Instant Rollback** - Disable problematic features immediately
- **Gradual Rollouts** - Test with small groups first
- **A/B Testing** - Compare old vs new behavior
- **Emergency Switches** - Kill features if issues arise

### 🔍 Professional Development:
This is exactly how major tech companies deploy:
- Netflix uses feature flags for all new features
- Facebook rolls out changes to small percentages first
- Google tests features with specific user groups
- Microsoft uses flags for gradual Office 365 rollouts

## 🧪 Current Feature Status

### ✅ Implemented Features:
- **Connection Resilience**: Auto-reconnection, timeout protection, error recovery
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Detailed WhatsApp monitoring stats
- **Health Endpoints**: HTTP health checks for Azure monitoring
- **Debug Commands**: Feature status and connection health commands
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to stable behavior if features fail

### 🔜 Future Features (ready for flags):
- User-specific feature rollouts
- Advanced AI response modes
- Custom cooldown settings
- Enhanced Discord integrations

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Deploy Current Code**: All features disabled by default
2. **Test Safely**: Enable features in Azure Portal
3. **Monitor**: Use new debug commands
4. **Roll Back**: Disable flags if needed
5. **Go Live**: Enable stable features for all users

Feature flags give you the power of professional deployment with the safety of instant rollback! 🚀
