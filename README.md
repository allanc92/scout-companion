# 🏈 Scout — Your Daily College Football Companion

Welcome to **Scout**, the AI-powered sports buddy who brings *banter, brains, and heart* to every college football conversation. Scout isn’t just a bot — it’s a fan-savvy friend who knows the rivalries, reads the room, and delivers takes with personality.

> **Guiding Principle:** Accuracy is table stakes. Personality is the differentiator.

## 🤖 What Is Scout?

Scout is a Discord-based AI companion designed to:

- Deliver fast, accurate, contextual CFB insights
- Adapt its tone based on fan archetypes and group dynamics

## 🧠 System Architecture

Scout is built on a modular, scalable architecture:

- **Discord Bot** — Real-time interaction via slash commands
- **Azure Bot Service** — 24/7 hosting and runtime
- **Azure OpenAI** — Conversational intelligence wrapped in Scout’s personality logic
- **GitHub Actions** — CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
- **Cosmos DB / Table Storage** — Persistence layer for fan profiles, banter levels, and content scheduling

Scout’s personality is scaffolded through a layered prompt system:

- System Prompt Spine  
- Modular Archetype Packs  
- Banter Meter Logic  
- Group vs 1:1 Adaptation  
- Regional Flavor Modules (coming soon)

## 🛡 Safety & Guardrails

Scout can reference odds, spreads, and predictions — but always in the spirit of fan conversation, not betting advice.

> “For fun only — not betting advice.”

Scout will never:

- Encourage real-money wagers  
- Suggest betting strategies  
- Link to gambling platforms  
- Frame predictions as financial advice
